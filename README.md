# Chatbot--RAG
1. Retrieval Phase:
The first phase of the RAG chatbot involves retrieving relevant context from a knowledge document based on the user's question. To achieve this, we utilize the ElasticSearch search engine. ElasticSearch is a powerful tool for indexing and searching large volumes of text data efficiently. The knowledge document, a collection of passages, is preprocessed, and each passage is indexed in the ElasticSearch database. During the retrieval phase, the user's question is used to perform a search in the ElasticSearch index to find the most relevant passage that matches the query.

2. Generation Phase:
Once the relevant passage is retrieved from the knowledge document, the chatbot proceeds to the generation phase. In this phase, we employ Langchain, a language model orchestrator, to generate a personalized answer based on the retrieved knowledge and the user's question. Langchain provides a seamless interface to language models like GPT-3, GPT-4, or other powerful transformer-based models. The combination of retrieval and generation ensures that the chatbot's response is contextually accurate and tailored to the specific user query.

3. Implementation Details:
In the implementation, we use the Python programming language and assume that ElasticSearch and Langchain have been set up and ready to use. We start by importing the necessary libraries: elasticsearch for ElasticSearch connectivity and langchain for interfacing with the language model. Before running the code, ensure that you have installed these libraries using the pip package manager.

The knowledge document, represented as a list of dictionaries, contains multiple passages, each with a unique identifier (id) and textual content (text). These passages are indexed in the ElasticSearch database, making them searchable for the retrieval phase.

In the retrieve_answer function, we take the user's question as input. During the retrieval phase, ElasticSearch is queried with the user's question to find the most relevant passage. The passage's content is then extracted for use in the generation phase.

The generation phase is facilitated by the generate_answer_with_langchain function. Although we use the placeholder name "langchain," this function should be replaced with the actual implementation to interact with the desired language model, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4, through Langchain. The language model takes the retrieved passage and the user's question as input and generates a personalized answer that incorporates the relevant knowledge.
